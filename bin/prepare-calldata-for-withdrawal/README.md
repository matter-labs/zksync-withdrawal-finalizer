This is a utility that prepares a calldata for `finalizeWithdrawals` call for a single
withdrawal with a known withdrawal id. Typically you use this calldata when tracing
unsuccessful withdrawals on a service such as `tenderly`.

Suppose you have a case of a single withdrawal being predicted as unfinalizable by
the contract:

```
message: "predicting results for withdrawals: [2069871]"
message: "predicted results for withdrawals: [Result { l_2_block_number: 271910, l_2_message_index: 1, gas: 0, success: false }]"
```

What you want to do is take the same calldata and trace it on `tenderly` to figure
out what is going on.

This utility allows you to connect to your prod database that contains this withdrawal 
and by providing the withdrawal id in question it constructs hax-encoded
calldata for you as such (note that you need to set the relevant gas limit for this withdrawal yourself):

```
cargo run -- -d $DATABASE_URL -w 2069871 -g 300000 
building finalization calldata for withdrawal with id 2069871

```

You can then take this calldata and perform tracing on `tenderly`.
